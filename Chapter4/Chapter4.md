## 4.1 Curve Fitting  
Suppose we have discrete data sets. We often want to represent the relationship as an analytical expression, such as a linear functionor or an exponential function. **Curve fitting** aims to find the values of parameters of the functions.  
  
The most popular definition of the best match or best fit is based on the **least-squares**. This is a nonlinear optimization problem in general. In Julia, the [LsqFit package](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/LsqFit.jl) implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
